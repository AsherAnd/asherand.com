            "description": "A Star Wars music album by the <a className='highlight' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK_iw5Yps2M&ab_channel=JoBloMovieClips'>Cantina Band</a> from A New Hope. This was one of the many things I made when I was bored during my first (online) year at university. Most of the things I've Photoshopped actually start off as jokes but after pouring some time into them, they start getting serious, and I get something that looks like this. I don't quite remember why I made this album cover (after checking my messages with one of my friends I was apparently bored and wanted to do something and randomly thought of the Cantina Band).\n\nI remember the thought process for making the image though. Besides the obvious “What if Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes (the Cantina Band) made an album?” it was also “What would the album cover look like?” that was going through my head. First off, it had to be written in <a className='highlight' href='https: //starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aurebesh'>Aurebsh</a> since it is set in the Star Wars universe. Second, it had to look like an album cover that people at first glance would look at and think this is an album cover. Artists sometimes take victorian portraits of themselves and make an album covers with it, take Ski Mask's <a className='highlight' href='https://ia800703.us.archive.org/25/items/mbid-1111b45b-d7d0-4cea-8ecd-9047ec7d0818/mbid-1111b45b-d7d0-4cea-8ecd-9047ec7d0818-21756197170.jpg'>Stokeley</a> album cover as an example. Lastly, the title of the album had to be good. I like to think I did that. If you want to confirm, translate the album cover and find out for yourself. This wasn't the first music album cover I've made but I would say this was probably my favorite.\n\nOriginal Images used: <a className='highlight' href='https: //free-images.com/display/herman_antonie_de_bloeme_0.html'>Portrait of Herman Antonie De Bloeme</a> and a <a className='highlight' href='https://www.therpf.com/forums/media/star-wars-bith-cantina-band-member-head.37187/'>a Bith head prop</a>",
